\chapter{Evaluation of Results}


Models will be evaluated with mean absolute percentage error (MAE) or accuracy where appropriate.
\begin{equation} MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y-\hat{y}| \end{equation}

To determine the practicability of the models, we will also evaluate how long the model takes to analyze images with and without a GPU. All evaluation was conducted on an Intel i5-6600K for the CPU and an NVIDIA GTX 1070 for the GPU.
