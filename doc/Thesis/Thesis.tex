I have read the attached thesis proposal and, in my opinion, it
proposes work which is adequate in depth and scope to serve as the
culminating experience for the Master's Degree in Computer Science.
I would agree to chair this committee or serve thereon.\\

The consistently increasing population entails a proportionately increased demand for food, or agricultural production.
However, such a demand for agricultural production cannot be easily met due to limited natural resources.
For example, at the current state of affairs, California does not have enough water to sustain all agricultural activities \cite{Medellin}.
Furthermore, these limited natural resources are needlessly diminished by careless agricultural practices.
Such practices have further ecological implications, evidenced by the excess use of fertilizers, such as nitrogen, leading to groundwater leaching \cite{Lin2001}.
In this work, we seek to address these problems by developing a system that utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning to analyze crop quality.
The data acquired from the UAV is processed by our algorithm, which informs end-users of the suggested treatments.
Specifically, the algorithm determines if additional irrigation or fertilization is necessary for each plant.
By developing an automated system for crop quality analysis, we conserve physical resources while reducing human labor and the ecological impact of agriculture.
